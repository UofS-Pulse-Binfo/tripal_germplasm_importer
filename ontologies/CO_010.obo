comment: Evaluation descriptors: The expression of many of the descriptors in this category will depend on the environment and, consequently, special environmental designs and techniques are needed to assess them. Their assessment may also require complex biochemical or molecular characterization methods. These types of descriptors include characters such as yield, agronomic performance, stress susceptibilities and biochemical and cytological traits. They are generally the most interesting traits in crop improvement.
